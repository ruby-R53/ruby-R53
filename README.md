## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm ruby R53, but you can call me "ruby".

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on `fpkg`, a simple package manager written in Bash.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bash scripting, and how to live like a normal person (kinda).
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simple projects by finding bugs and/or suggesting UI enhancements.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with staying motivated to learn more.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: my Discord tag is `ruby.53`.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: any :D
- âš¡ Fun fact: one horse actually has 24 horsepower!
