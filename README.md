## Hi there 👋

I'm ruby R53, but you can call me "ruby".

- 🔭 I’m currently working on `fpkg`, a simple package manager written in Bash, and C64play, a SID tune player based on sidplayfp.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bash scripting and C++.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects I like by finding bugs and suggesting enhancements.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with staying motivated to learn more.
- 💬 Ask me about anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: my Discord tag is `ruby.53`. You can also shoot me an email: `red_M95@proton.me`.
- 😄 Pronouns: any :D
- ⚡ Fun fact: one horse actually has 24 horsepower!
